# CheckStorage2

## About
CheckStorage2 – an improved version of CheckStorage for macOS Tahoe.

## Features
- Real-time disk usage monitoring
- Colorful and customizable progress bars
- All objects in the widget can be customized in color, size, and position, allowing better matching with macOS Tahoe’s personalization features.
- The widget settings are centralized within the app, enabling intuitive configuration using sliders.

## Notes
- Compared to the previous CheckStorage, accuracy may be reduced.
- The app uses the .glassEffect() function, so behavior on macOS versions earlier than Tahoe is not guaranteed.
- Data is exchanged using @AppStorage, which may cause delays in widget settings being applied (currently rarely observed).
